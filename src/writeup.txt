This code is completed with the assistance of Github Copilot v1.181.0, and JetBrain's AI assistant.

Example of how copilot is used:

    public static void checkWin(Player player0, Player player1) {
    //
        if (!player0.hasCards()) {
            WIN = true;
            return;
        }
        if (!player1.hasCards()) {
            WIN = true;
        }
    }

The copilot suggestion is "Check if a player has no cards". If I press tab, it will implement the solution to be as:

    public static void checkWin(Player player0, Player player1) {
        //Check if a player has no cards
        if (!player0.hasCards()) {
            WIN = true;
            return;
        }
        if (!player1.hasCards()) {
            WIN = true;
        }
    }

The comments in this project are completed in this manner.
